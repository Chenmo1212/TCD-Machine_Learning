## Description
This is a code repository of Machine Learning model group assignment of TCD on WIC Attendance Prediction


## Proposal
WIC is an American federal assistance program for healthcare and nutrition. 
The WIC program aims to safeguard the health of low-income women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets, information on healthy eating, and referrals to health care.
WIC made a difference for over 196,000 women, infants and children in Washington in 2021.

Based on the data about the Food Environment Atlas released by U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, combined with the number of participants in WIC over the years, we built a model to predict the number of participants in WIC in the future.
